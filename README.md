Project Title:

Optimizing the 15-Dimensional Rastrigin Function Using Simulated Annealing

Objective:

The objective of this project is to apply the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to find an
approximate global minimum of the Rastrigin test function with 15 input values (15
dimensions). The function is known for its large number of local minima, making it an ideal
benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of optimization techniques.

The diagram below shows the output of two dimensional (2 inputs) Rastrigin function with
many local minima and the global minimum at location (0,0):
